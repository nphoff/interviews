d3 Interview
---

Hello!

The objective of this interview is to visualize the data set found at ```./data/experiment.json``` using d3.

The question of how to visualize the data is left entierly up to the interviewee, but they should be able to justify their choice of visualization.

```index.html``` is a basic page with jQuery and d3 included, as well as ```main.js```.

You can start a local server where you are on port 8080 with:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080```

_You are free to reference whatever you would like!_

Good luck! Have some fun!
